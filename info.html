  A high-quality diet combined with fasting can offer several health benefits.<br>
  It is linked to an improved lipid profile, including lower LDL (“bad” cholesterol) and triglyceride levels, and promotes increased fat utilization, as the body shifts toward using stored fat for energy after several hours without food.<br>
  Fasting may also support better appetite regulation by balancing hunger hormones, particularly when late-night overeating is avoided, and some individuals experience a mild reduction in blood pressure during the fasting period.<br>
  The effectiveness of these benefits depends on key factors such as eating balanced meals with sufficient protein, complex carbohydrates, and vegetables, staying properly hydrated between sunset and dawn, and limiting excessive sugar and fried foods.
