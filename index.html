    <h2 id="title">Ramdan</h2>
    <div id="ram">Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar and holds great significance in Islam. During this month, fasting is prescribed for Muslims as one of the Five Pillars of Islam. From dawn until sunset, Muslims abstain from food, drink, and other physical needs as an act of worship and obedience to God.

Fasting in Ramadan is not only about refraining from eating and drinking; it is a discipline that strengthens self-control, encourages gratitude, and promotes spiritual growth. The month is also marked by increased prayer, charity, reflection, and recitation of the Qur’an. It serves as a time for personal reform, moral awareness, and renewed commitment to faith.

Allah says in the Quran:

﴿ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِنْ قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ ﴾
Surah Al-Baqarah (2:183)

This verse explains that the purpose of fasting is to attain taqwa (God-consciousness), which means developing awareness of God, self-discipline, and moral responsibility.</div>
